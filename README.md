# MazeBall
A simple dexterity game with arduino and two servos

My favourite electronics distributor published another DIY toy, made out of plywood. It is kind of a balance game, called "Joy Ball Wizard" where you can move a bearing ball on a movable plate using a joystick. That project has a german description, made by JÃ¼rgen Grzesina, which can be found here: https://www.az-delivery.de/blogs/azdelivery-blog-fur-arduino-und-raspberry-pi/joy-ball-wizzard-mit-micropython-und-esp8266-teil-2

From there, I started my own project. First, I created some 3D parts to avoid that woodwork. Than I found the "Labyrinth Ball Table" project and I remixed both designs to one. I fully redesigned my whole thing again and used just the plate with the labyrinth from the ball table project. I used an ESP32 board "WEMOS D1 R32" instead of UNO board. A breadboard works well without soldering. Just drawn it in hot glue to make it reliable.

Code, photo, video and STL files all is published here.

Credits go to Vincent Lescault (trentesous) for the maze design! Thank you very much. Note: I did not upload the file LB_MAZE_3DP_2.STL, please get it from trentesous project: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4678522 Anyway, the file is contained in the my fusion360-file, you can export it from there, too.

The project will be extended to use a wireless gravity control some day.
